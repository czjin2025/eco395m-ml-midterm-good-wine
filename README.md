## 1. Problem Statement
This project aims to predict wine quality scores based on physicochemical properties, replicating and extending the study by Cortez et al. (2009). The goal is to develop a regression model that can accurately predict human taste preferences, which traditionally rely on subjective expert evaluation. We compare four different regression techniques to identify the model that best balances predictive accuracy and interpretability.

## 2. Data Understanding

### 2.1. Source and Collection
The dataset is the publicly available **Wine Quality Dataset** from UCI. It contains physicochemical and sensory data for Vinho Verde wine samples from Portugal. The data was collected between 2004 and 2007 by the official certification entity (CVRVV) and represents a large, real-world sample.

### 2.2. Data Description
We analyze red and white wine variants separately due to their distinct characteristics. The datasets are clean with no missing values.
*   **Red Wine:** 1,599 samples
*   **White Wine:** 4,898 samples

**Input Features (11):**
*   Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol.

**Target Variable:**
*   `quality`: Sensory score (median of at least 3 evaluations), ranging from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent).

### 2.3. Data Limitations
The target variable is a subjective human score, which introduces inherent variability. While the physicochemical tests are objective, the relationship between these properties and taste is complex and not fully captured by the data alone.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Modeling Approach
We treat wine quality prediction as a regression problem. Four models are implemented and compared:
*   **Linear Regression:** Serves as a baseline interpretable model.
*   **XGBoost:** A powerful, non-linear tree-based ensemble method.
*   **Random Forest:** Another robust tree-based ensemble method.
*   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A non-linear model effective in high-dimensional spaces.

### 3.2. Evaluation Protocol
To ensure robust and fair comparison:
*   **Data Preprocessing:** All features are standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
*   **Validation:** We use **5-fold cross-validation repeated 20 times** (100 total experiments per model configuration), as recommended in the original paper to obtain stable performance estimates.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Model performance is assessed using standard regression metrics:
    *   **MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation):** Average absolute error.
    *   **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
    *   **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Error in the same units as the target variable.

## 4. Results and Discussion

### 4.1. Model Performance Comparison
The table below summarizes the cross-validated performance of all models for both red and white wines. Lower values indicate better predictive accuracy.

| Model | Red Wine (MAD) | Red Wine (RMSE) | White Wine (MAD) | White Wine (RMSE) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Linear Regression | 0.505 | 0.652 | 0.586 | 0.754 |
| XGBoost | **0.411** | 0.610 | 0.452 | 0.637 |
| Random Forest | 0.419 | **0.582** | **0.434** | **0.609** |
| SVM | 0.460 | 0.625 | 0.517 | 0.688 |

*Table: Model performance based on 5x20 cross-validation. Best scores for each metric and wine type are highlighted in bold.*

A visual comparison of all three metrics for each wine type is provided below:

### 4.2. Feature Importance
Analyzing feature importance across models reveals the key drivers of wine quality. The plot shows the average importance of the top features:

**alcohol** is consistently the most important predictor, confirming the oenological theory that higher alcohol content is associated with higher quality. **Volatile acidity**, **density**, **residual sugar**, and **sulphates** also play significant roles.

### 4.3. Comparison with Original Paper
Our results align well with the findings of Cortez et al. (2009). Their reported MAD for Linear Regression was ~0.50 for red wine and ~0.59 for white wine, which closely matches our results (0.505 and 0.586).

**Why are some results different?** 
The original paper concluded that SVM was the best model overall. However, our study includes two additional models not tested in the original paper: **XGBoost and Random Forest**. These tree-based ensemble methods capture non-linear relationships better than SVM, leading to improved performance:
- For red wine, XGBoost (MAD=0.411) outperforms the paper's SVM (0.46)
- For white wine, Random Forest (MAD=0.434) outperforms the paper's SVM (0.517)

This demonstrates that modern tree-based models can achieve even better accuracy than the methods available in 2009.

## 5. Recommendations and Conclusion

Based on our analysis, we make the following **clear recommendations**:

| Wine Type | **Recommended Model** | Key Metric (MAD) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Red Wine** | **XGBoost** | 0.411 |
| **White Wine** | **Random Forest** | 0.434 |

**Why these models?**
- Tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) consistently outperform linear models and SVM
- They capture complex non-linear relationships that simpler models miss
- The choice differs by wine type because red and white wines have different chemical compositions

If interpretability is the top priority, Linear Regression remains an option, but with a significant trade-off in accuracy (about 20% higher error).

The analysis confirms that **alcohol content** is the single most important predictor of wine quality across all models.
